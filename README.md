# Hello, it's Silvan Gehrig
I work as a technical education teacher at BWZ Rapperswil-Jona. Additionally, I teach in postgraduate programs as a lecturer at the [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (OST)](https://github.com/sgeh), specializing in software design and architecture, as well as web and touch-oriented technologies.

## Tutorials
The following tutorials were created for professional training courses. However, the tutorials are also significant outside of the classroom and are intended to provide an easy introduction to the technology.
- [Angular Heroes Tutorial](https://bwz-rappi-m323.azurewebsites.net/)
- [Vue and Ionic Tutorial](https://bwz-rappi-m335.azurewebsites.net/)

## My Projects
In my free time, I work on projects in the field of innovative thinking, assemble custom computer configurations, and contribute to various [open-source projects](https://www.silvanonline.ch/projects).
